# Chess Final 
## This project successfully accomplishes these tasks: 
1. Get data in an interval from an external api (chess.com API)
2. This data is current and updating overtime, albeit slowly
3. Shape data to how i want it and put it in my mongoDB atlas cluster
4. Perform api calls to my own api where I return  a query  result from my mongodb to the controller
5. Express this data through pug templates
6. Allow users to choose what data to see from a dropdown menu 
7. Perform both post and get request to my API 

While designing this project, I attempted to code it in such a way that would allow it to be developed further in the future. Alot that I wrote was later split into methods for easier reading and alot of effort was put into its design and cleanliness

## This project was unable to accomplish these tasks:
1. Angular was originally a huge part of the project, I decided to drop all Angular aspects. They are not worth including in the submission
2. I do not have error handling for when my external api returns null, if the player did not play any games that month my code breaks 
3. I did not put any effort into status codes being sent or anything like that, I prioritized my other goals 
4. front-end is very lacking, its a good thing this is a back-end class


## To accomplish this project I used: 
1. Clive and Simon wrote a great book. I used it alot more than I thought I would.
2. Postman was incredibly helpful throuhgout this process, and Deployment to Heroku was really cool. I have been showing family and friends what I am working on. It also allowed some of us to see the progress others were making and talk about how we did that etc...
